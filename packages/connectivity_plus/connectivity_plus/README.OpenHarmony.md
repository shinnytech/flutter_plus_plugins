> [!TIP] If the value of **ohos Support** is **yes**, it means that the ohos platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

### Connectivity API 
| Name                | Description                         | Type     | Input | Output  | ohos Support |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Connectivity()      | Constructs a singleton instance of [Connectivity] | function | / | Connectivity | yes |
| onConnectivityChanged | Fires whenever the connectivity state changes. On iOS, the connectivity status might not update when WiFi status changes, this is a known issue that only affects simulators. | function | / | Stream<ConnectivityResult> | yes |
| checkConnectivity   | Checks the connection status of the device. Do not use the result of this function to decide whether you can reliably make a network request. It only gives you the radio status. | function | / | Future<ConnectivityResult> | yes |
