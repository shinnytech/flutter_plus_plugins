/**
 * System channel to exchange restoration data between framework and engine.
 *
 * <p>The engine can obtain the current restoration data from the framework via this channel to
 * store it on disk and - when the app is relaunched - provide the stored data back to the framework
 * to recreate the original state of the app.
 *
 * <p>The channel can be configured to delay responding to the framework's request for restoration
 * data via {@code waitForRestorationData} until the engine-side has provided the data. This is
 * useful when the engine is pre-warmed at a point in the application's life cycle where the
 * restoration data is not available yet. For example, if the engine is pre-warmed as part of the
 * Application before an Activity is created, this flag should be set to true because Android will
 * only provide the restoration data to the Activity during the onCreate callback.
 *
 * <p>The current restoration data provided by the framework can be read via {@code
 * getRestorationData()}.
